\section{Amphibious Invasion}

Amphibious Invasion involves various special procedures. Many Allied units enter play only through amphibious invasion procedure. Only the Allied player can conduct amphibious invasions.

\subsection{Invasion Planning}

There are five possible amphibioius invasion operations, each identified by a code-name. There is also a sixth "No Invasion" dummy operation the Allied player can use for deception purposes.

\subsubsection{} The planning time and unit allocation for initial operations has already been built into the Allied scenario set-ups. Place the applicable marker(s) (face down) on Turn One of the Turn Record Track and reveal it after Axis set-up is complete.

\subsubsection{} All subsequent amphibious invasion planning is done during the Strategic Segment. Once the Allied player has decided on making a subsequent amphibious invasion, he places the Invasion Code Marker representing it upside down on the Turn Record Track at least five game-turns ahead of the current game-turn. It can be cancelled by removing the marker. The marker can be moved ahead [13.1.4], but once the Game Turn marker reaches the turn box containing the Invasion marker the operation must be executed.

\textbf{Exception:} \textit{The invasion must be delayed one turn if weather includes Storm on the turn of invasion}

The Axis player may not examine the marker until revealed.

\subsubsection{} The Allied player decides which units will make any subsequent invasions, but each subsequent invasion must be made by units of the same nationality [14.2]. All units must start in the Allied Africa Holding Box.

\subsubsection{} Once a Subsequent Operation marker has been placed, during the Special Movement Phase of that turn, the Allied player should move all desired units into the Amphibious Invasion Box. Starting on the next turn, no new units can be added to the Amphibious Invasion Units Box without moving the Invasion Operation marker ahead five game-turns from the current game-turn.

\subsubsection{} Once a Subsequent Operation marker has been placed, units may be moved into or out of the Follow-On Box (as soon as all units from any prior operations have exited) during any Special Movement Phase prior to the turn on which the operation is conducted.

\subsubsection{} Units in the Africa Holding Box can use naval transport to land at friendly operating ports secured by subsequent amphibious operations.

\subsubsection{} Once an amphibious invasion operation has been conducted, it cannot be conducted again.

\subsection{Invasion Procedure}

Each amphibious invasion consists of picking up units from the Amphibious Invasion Box and placing them onto special hexes called invasion hexes. Each invasion hex has an arrow pointing toward the targeted coastal hex where units in the invasion hex must land.

\subsubsection{} During his Transport Phase, the Allied player places Amphibious Invasion units on invasion hexes allowed by the operation. Unless specified by scenario setup instructions, units designated for an invasion operation can be placed on any invasion hex designated with the codename for that invasion [Allied Set-Up Card]. Not all invasion hexes need to \textcolor{blue}{be} used. Place no more than eleven stacking points per invasion hex.

\subsubsection{} Combat units (except for Commando units) cannot be placed on an invasion hex without a Beach unit.

\subsubsection{} During the Allied Movement Phase, units on invasion hexes that face no opposing enemy units in their targeted coastal hexes automatically move ashore at one-half MA (rounding down), paying the non-road MP cost to enter that hex. Units may always occupy their targeted coastal hex regardless of MP cost to enter (an exception to rule 7.3.2, which requires a unit to have sufficient MPs to enter any hex).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Once ashore, each unit makes an ER check. Those that pass may continue moving (if possible) with any remaining MPs in their one-half MA. Each ER die roll is modified by the off-road terrain cost (+1, +2, +3) of the coastal hex the unit entered.
    \item Those failing their ER checks stop all remaining movement for the rest of the Movement Phase and remain on the coastal hex.
    \item Regardless of whether units remain on their coastal hexes or advance from them, they are eligible to participate in declared combats against adjacent enemy units (including Amphibious Assaults made by units still occupying invasion hexes).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{} Units on invasion hexes that face enemy units in their targeted coastal hexes remain there during the Movement Phase and must attack those enemy units during the Combat Phase.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item They cannot participate in combat against any other adjoining hex. The arrow in the invasion hex acts as a Combat Declaration Marker point to the targeted coastal hex.
    \item Units already on land can join invading units in combat but must pass Combat Coordination.
    \item The invasion hex is always the Lead hex in a multi-hex declared combat.
    \item Any declared combat (single or multi-hex) involving Allied units on invasion hexes automatically receives a +1 DRM.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{} Amphibious Invasion units (including Beach units) that fail to clear the opposing coastal hex of enemy units must conduct Emergency Evacuation [13.3]. An Emergency Evacuation from one coastal hex or invasion hex does not affect combat from another invastion hex.

\subsubsection{} The Beach unit and combat units on the invasion hex must move into the targeted coastal hex if the attack is successful.

\subsubsection{} If a zero strength Coast Defense unit is revealed during combat resolution, up to eleven attacking Allied stacking points (starting with those units on the invasion hex) can be moved into the vacant coastal hex, but none of the units involved in the declared attack against the zero strength unit can participate in any other declared attacks.

\subsubsection{} During the Special Movement Phase of the Invasion Turn, combat units still in the Amphibious Invasion Box move to the Follow-up Box or the Africa Holding Box. Beach units move to the Africa Holding Box.
