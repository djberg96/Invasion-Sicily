\section{Strongpoints}

Strongpoints represent field fortifications that benefit only the Axis player. Strongpoints must be built.

\subsection{Strongpoint Construction}

\subsubsection{} Only the Axis player can construct strongpoints.

\subsubsection{} One strongpoint may be constructed during each turn in the Engineering Phase.

\subsubsection{} Construction can take place on any friendly Axis hex that can trace a supply route to an Axis supply source.

\subsubsection{} Only one strongpoint is allowed per hex.

\subsubsection{} The Axis player declares which qualifying hex is to receive the strongpoint, and places a strongpoint marker there. The hex does not have to be occupied by an Axis ground combat unit.

\subsection{Strongpoint Effects}

\subsubsection{} If a defender hex includes a strongpoint, the attacker adds one to his combat die roll result.

\subsubsection{} An Axis strongpoint blocks the tracing of an Allied supply route through the hex it occupies.

\subsubsection{} A unit spends one additional MP to enter a hex containing an enemy strongpoint.

\subsubsection{} Axis units have the No Retreat option when occupying a strongpoint on attack or defense.

\subsubsection{} Strongpoints continue to function in all respects until destroyed.

\subsubsection{} An Axis strongpoint is destroyed when any Allied ground combat unit occupies that hex during the Engineering Phase. Remove it from the map at the conclusion of the Phase.
