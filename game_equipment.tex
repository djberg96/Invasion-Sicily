\subsection{The Playing Pieces}

\par
\subsubsection{}
There are two types of playing pieces in \textit{Invasion: Sicily}: First, markers are informational pieces used to assist and enhance game play. Second, units are playing pieces that represent the combat units that fought (or could have fought) in Sicily.

\subsubsection{}
For an explanation of unit values, see the How To Read Units player aid card.

\subsubsection{}
The game uses a ten-sided die. The number "0" is read as ten (10), not zero (0).

\subsubsection{}
To perform many game functions, you will roll one die to determine a result. Often, you will modify the actual die roll result plus (+) or minus (-) as explained in the rules below; these are called Die Roll Modifiers (DRM's).
