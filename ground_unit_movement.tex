\section{Ground Unit Movement}
During his Movement Phases, a player can move qualifying non-Beach/Port units.

Move units or stacks one at a time, tracing a path of contiguous hexes through the hex grid. Each unit expends a number of MPs from its MA to enter each hex or cross certain hexsides [TEC].

\subsection{Movement Restrictions}

Eligible units may move during the Movement, Motorized Movement, and Special Movement Phases, or when executing Reaction Movement. These are the only times when "movement", as described below, is conducted. During the Combat Phase, units of either side may advance or retreat after each combat is resolved; this is not considered movement for the purposes of these rules, and uses no MPs.

\subsubsection{}
Move units from hex to adjacent hex. A unit cannot jump over a hex.

\subsubsection{}
There is no limit to the number of friendly units that can pass through a single hex during a game-turn. Stacking limits apply only at the end of each phase and at the completion of retreats.

\subsubsection{}
At the discretion of the owning player, units can be moved together as a stack [3.2]. The MA of stacked units is that of the slowest unit in that stack, but faster units can be moved off at any time with the remainder of their MA. Stacks cannot pick up or add units while moving. Once a stack has ceased moving, other units may be moved into or through its hex (subject to stacking limits at the end of the phase).

\subsubsection{}
A unit can move only once in a Phase. It can never expend more MPs than its total MA in any one Phase.

\subsubsection{}
A unit is never forced to move.

\subsubsection{}
Unused MPs cannot be saved for later use or transferred to other units.

\subsubsection{}
A friendly unit can never enter a hex containing an enemy ground combat unit. It can move through friendly occupied or controlled hexes (those not in an enemy ZOC) at no extra cost.

\subsubsection{}
You may not move a unit off the edge of the map or onto terrain prohibited to it. Units forced to retreat off the map or onto prohibited terrain are eliminated.

\textbf{Exception:} \textit{Calabria north map edge for the Axis [7.6.5a]}

\subsection{ZOC Effects on Movement}

\subsubsection{}
Units spend one additional MP to enter an enemy ZOC. There are no MP penalties to leave an enemy ZOC. Units need not stop moving upon entering enemy ZOC and can move directly from one enemy-controlled hex to another, during the same phase, as long as they have sufficient MPs.

\subsubsection{}
Friendly ZOCs do not affect the movement of your units.

\subsection{Terrain Effects on Movement}

\subsubsection{}
Each hex contains one or more terrain types. The Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) identifies the terrain and lists the movement point costs a unit expends to enter various terrain types during Dry or Mud weather [5.1]. Where a hex contains more than one type of terrain (for example, clear and hill), units moving through the hex pay the highest movement cost, except when moving on roads under certain weather conditions [TEC].

\textbf{Example:} \textit{In Dry weather a unit would pay 2 MPs to move through a hex containing both clear and hill terrain.}

\subsubsection{}
A unit cannot enter a hex if it does not have sufficient MPs remaining to pay terrain and enemy ZOC costs.

\textbf{Exception:} \textit{Amphibious Invasion units can always enter their targeted coastal hexes [13.2.3].}

\subsubsection{}
A unit that eneters a hex through a road hexside expends Mps according to that road's rate regardless of the other terrain in the hex. A road hex does not negate the cost to enter an enemy ZOC.

\textbf{Example:} \textit{A non-clear hex contains a minor road. A unit entering this hex through a minor road hexside would pay one MP to enter. If the road in the hex were a main road, the MP cost to enter would be 1/2 MP, regardless of terrain.}

\subsubsection{}
A number of terrain features (such as rivers) are found only on hexsides. A unit expends MPs to cross these hexside features, in addition to the cost of entering the terrain in the hex itself. Units crossing river hexsides on a road crosses a river hexide) move at that road's rate and do not expend the additional hexside cost for the river.

\subsubsection{}
Armor and artillery units cannot enter mountain or alpine hexes through non-road hexsides.
