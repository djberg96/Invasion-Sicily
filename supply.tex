\section{Supply}
A unit's supply status affects its actions throughout the entire game turn.

\subsection{Off-Map Supply}
\subsubsection{}
Axis units are always in supply in the Italy Holding Box and the Axis Emergency Evacuation Box.

\subsubsection{
}Allied units are always in supply in the Africa Holding box, Amphibious Invasion Box, Follow-Up Box, and Emergency Evacuation Box.

\subsection{On-Map Supply Effects}
To be in supply, a unit must be able to trace a Supply Route through a path of contiguous hexes from the unit to a supply source. Judge the supply state for all units of both sides during the Supply Determination Phase. A unit's supply state remains the same for the entire game-turn. A unit judged Out of Supply (OoS) during this phase is OoS for the rest of the game turn, even if it moves back into supply later.

\textbf{Exception:} \textit{Air Supply [11.2.2c]}

\subsubsection{}
A unit is in supply if, during the Supply Determination Phase, it can:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item trace a Supply Route to a supply source \textit{and}
    \item the supply source has the unit capacity available to supply the unit.
\end{enumerate}

If both conditions \textit{cannot} be met, the unit is out of supply.

\subsubsection{}
To indicate a unit's supply status:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Remove OoS markers from units that meet both conditions of 5.2.1 a and b.
    \item Place (or retain) OoS markers on all units judged to be out of supply.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{}
Each unit carrying an OoS marker is affected as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Reduce its printed MA by half (drop fractions) during its Movement and Motorized Movement Phases (if motorized).
    \item It cannot conduct Combat Refusal or Reaction Movement (if motorized).
    \item Reduce AS by half (rounding down), and ER by two (-2) during combat (only).
    \item If artillery, it cannot contribute its support strength on attack or defense.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tracing On-Map Supply}
\subsubsection{}
An on-map unit can trace supply through five non-road hexes to a supply source [5.3.3 and 5.3.4] or to a road net [5.3.5] leading to a supply source.

\subsubsection{}
You cannot trace supply:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item across sea hexsides;
    \item into or through non-destroyed enemy strongpoints [12.0];
    \item into or through alpine hexes unless:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
        \item tracing units are mountain or commando types, or
        \item supply can be traced into or through such hexes along a Road Net for all other unit types;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item through hexes occupied by enemy ground combat units or vacant hexes in an uncontested enemy ZOC.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{}
Axis on-map supply sources are:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Sicily: any Axis-controlled ports.
    \item Calabria: any Axis-controlled ports and any north map edge land hex of the Calabria playing area (Scenarios 3 and 4).
\end{enumerate}
