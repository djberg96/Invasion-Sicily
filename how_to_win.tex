\section{How To Win}

The Allied player wins the game by scoring sufficient Victory Points (VPs) to achieve the desired Level of Victory as shown on the Level of Victory Chart. The Axis player wins by preventing the Allied player from achieving his minimum Level of Victory. Players win a higher or lower level of victory depending on the final Allied VP total. Refer to the Playbook or Map VP charts for VPs and VP categories.
